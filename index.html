			<p>I developed a ray tracing engine for the rendering of terrain heightfields. I implemented two versions of the engine: one for single heightfields, and a second for large terrains split into multiple tiles. Both engines run at real-time frame rates using simple ray-casting as well as secondary ray tracing for shadows, even with excessively large active regions, at a resolution of 1920x1080.</p>
